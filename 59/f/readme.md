Pass1
This Rust-based command-line application provides a straightforward method for encrypting and decrypting files using a user-provided password. The application uses a simple XOR encryption technique, making it easy to use for basic file security. It processes files in chunks, allowing it to handle both small and large files efficiently without consuming excessive memory. Below is a detailed explanation of how the application works, including its features and usage instructions.

Key Features
1. XOR-Based Encryption
The core encryption mechanism of the application uses the XOR (exclusive OR) operation, a fundamental binary operation that combines bits from the data and the derived key. This method is simple yet effective for basic obfuscation, especially when used with sufficiently complex and unique keys.

2. Password-Derived Key
The encryption key is derived from a user-provided password. The key derivation process involves converting the password into bytes and then performing a series of transformations to produce a key of fixed length (256 bytes in this case). The key derivation function cycles through the password bytes and applies additional transformations to increase complexity, making the key more resilient against simple attacks.

3. Chunk-Based File Processing
To manage memory usage efficiently, the application reads and processes the input file in chunks of 1 MB. This chunk-based approach ensures that even very large files can be encrypted or decrypted without requiring a large amount of memory, making the tool suitable for use on systems with limited resources.

4. Overwrite File Handling
The application reads the data from the file, encrypts or decrypts it, and writes it back to the same file, effectively overwriting the original data. This feature eliminates the need for separate output files and simplifies the workflow, although users should be aware of the risks of data loss if an error occurs during processing.

Usage Instructions
Command-Line Arguments
The application requires three command-line arguments:

Mode: Specify 'e' for encryption or 'd' for decryption.
File Name: The path to the file to be processed.
Password: The password used for key derivation, which can include numbers, special characters, uppercase, and lowercase letters. There is no strict limit on the password length.
Example Commands
To encrypt a file named example.txt using the password mypassword:
./pass e example.txt mypassword
To decrypt a file named example.txt using the same password:

./pass d example.txt mypassword


Considerations and Limitations
While this application provides a basic level of encryption, it should not be relied upon for securing highly sensitive or confidential data. The XOR encryption technique and the simple key derivation process do not meet modern cryptographic standards. Users are encouraged to use strong, complex passwords and consider additional security measures for more critical data protection needs. Additionally, because the file is overwritten in place, users should ensure that they have backups of important data to prevent accidental loss.

This tool is best suited for educational purposes or for scenarios where basic data obfuscation is sufficient. For robust security requirements, it is recommended to use established cryptographic libraries and algorithms that provide strong encryption, key management, and data integrity guarantees.
