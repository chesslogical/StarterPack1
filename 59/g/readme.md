This utility provides a simple command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting files using XOR-based encryption. To use the tool, you need to run the program with three arguments: the mode of operation (e for encryption or d for decryption), the name of the file you want to process, and a password to secure the file. The syntax is as follows: <program> <e|d> <file> <password>. For example, to encrypt a file named example.txt with the password mysecret, you would run the command: program e example.txt mysecret. This would produce an encrypted file named example.txt.enc. To decrypt, you would use: program d example.txt.enc mysecret, which restores the original file if the correct password is provided.

Encryption Mechanism
The encryption mechanism employed by this utility is based on XOR (exclusive OR) operations. XOR is a simple yet effective method of encryption that involves taking each byte of the file's data and performing a bitwise XOR operation with a corresponding byte from a key. This key is derived from the user-provided password, ensuring that the same password is required to decrypt the file. The key derivation function cycles through the password bytes, adding the current index to each byte to create variability and extend the key to the necessary length. The derived key is then used to XOR each byte of the file, effectively scrambling the data. To decrypt the file, the same key and XOR operation are applied, which reverses the scrambling process and restores the original content.

One of the key properties of XOR encryption is that it is symmetrical, meaning the same operation can be used for both encryption and decryption. However, to safeguard against accidental data loss or overwriting, the utility includes checks to prevent overwriting existing files. During encryption, if an output file with the .enc extension already exists, the program will abort the operation to avoid overwriting. Similarly, during decryption, if the original file name (without the .enc extension) exists, the program will also exit to prevent overwriting the original content. This makes the utility a simple yet effective tool for securing files, suitable for educational purposes or scenarios where robust security is not a critical requirement.
