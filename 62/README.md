Bash Scripts for the discerning coder. Keep in mind that in Bash, dealing with very large files is problematic due to memory concerns. Bash is powerful and awesome- you can code all sorts of apps in bash! Just know its limitations and expect reasonable results! If you have any useful bash scripts feel free to share! I frequent switch back and forth from windows to linux for learning purposes. For a while i will be back to coding for windows, so this repo will not be updated for a while.
